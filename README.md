## Description

Using Xcode's IB (interface builder) editor, the layout for this 15 puzzle game programmatically controls the size and position of the game tiles. The tiles are organized in a 4x4 grid with and ordered randomly. One tile can be slid into the empty face at a time with the purpose of the game to move the tiles in order. The FifteenBoard.swift functions determine whether a tile can be moved, where it moves, and whether the game is won.
